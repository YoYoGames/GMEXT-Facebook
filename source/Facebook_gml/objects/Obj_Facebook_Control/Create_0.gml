Note that Facebook now insists you test/deploy using https, which is not the default for GMSs'2 micro webserver.
Accordingly, you will need to test HTML5 builds after uploading to your own website, and bear this in mind 
when deploying your final live website!

For more info, see https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/06/08/enforce-https-facebook-login/
