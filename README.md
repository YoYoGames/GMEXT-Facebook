## Important

Do not download from the **main branch** this branch is a work in place branch and probably has features that might be broken or not working properly, please download from the releases panel (right side instead).

## Documentation

We provide both a PDF version of the documentation included with the extension and inside the demo project (datafiles) and a fully converted version to the [Github Wiki](../../wiki) format (the latter will be the most up-to-date version, the other will follow shortly after). *If there are any PR requests with new feature implementation please make sure you also provide the documentation for the implemented features.*
